## This image is modified version of laravel to run on Azure webApp service (Nginx configuration)

### Steps to install laravel on Azure webApp service 

1. create the azure webApp (code php 8.0).
2. ssh to the webApp :
- make a copy of the default file in `/etc/nginx/sites-available/`
    `cp /etc/nginx/sites-available/default /home/site/default`
- edit the copied version and change the root to `/home/site/wwwroot/public`, save and exit
    `nano /home/site/default`
3. _(Optional)_ In case problem with working Laravel routes, replace `index index.php index.html index.htm hostingstart.html;` by `try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;`. If problem continues use `try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$args;` insted of.
4. Azure installs git repos from the Deployment Center totally different (`GitHub` vs `External Git` ), for me the only way it works if you've forked the repo to your github account and pull it to your webApp using the `GitHub` option under the CI/CD in the Source section.
> Note:Definatly you don't have to fork my repo if you want to pull a fresh one from [laravel](https://github.com/laravel/laravel) you'll just need to run the command in the `startup.sh` file separately, also you can delete the `.htaccess` file. 
5. Once you've linked your repo from the Deployment Center this will kick a Github action in your account for building and deploying.
6. Navigate to Configuration -> General setting -> set the startup command to `/home/site/wwwroot/startup.sh` and Save, check your website and it should be up and running (Make sure browser session is not cached).





## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.
